# IT Support KPI Scorecard – Power BI Dashboard

## Overview

This project is a Power BI dashboard created to analyze IT support ticket data and evaluate support performance using a KPI scorecard. The dashboard focuses on support workload, ticket urgency, and department wise performance.

The main idea of this project is to transform raw ticket data into clear KPIs and compare actual performance against defined targets using simple traffic light indicators.

##Why This Project

In IT support environments, raw ticket data alone does not clearly show whether teams are performing well or facing capacity issues. This dashboard helps convert ticket data into meaningful KPIs so performance can be monitored easily at both department and organization level.

The project also demonstrates how KPI targets can change dynamically based on the selected departments, ensuring fair and meaningful evaluation.

## What the Dashboard Shows

- Total number of support tickets

- Percentage of high priority tickets

- Ticket distribution by department

- Ticket priority mix

- KPI status using green, yellow, and red indicators

Ticket volume targets automatically scale based on the selected departments, so KPI results remain meaningful whether one department or all departments are selected.

## Data Used

- IT Support Ticket dataset

- Format: CSV

- Public dataset sourced from Kaggle
